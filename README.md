# Blockchain Commons Random Number Utilities

### _by Leonardo Custodio_

**`bc-rand-ts`** provides cryptographically secure random number generation and deterministic, seeded random sequences for Blockchain Commons libraries.

## Installation Instructions

[@blockchaincommons/rand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockchaincommons/rand) is published to npm. Install it with your package manager of choice:

```sh
npm install @blockchaincommons/rand
# or
pnpm add @blockchaincommons/rand
# or
yarn add @blockchaincommons/rand
# or
bun add @blockchaincommons/rand
```

## Usage Instructions

```typescript
import { SeededRng, SecureRng, secureRng, randomBytes, randomBool } from "@blockchaincommons/rand";
import { nextWithUpperBoundU32, nextInClosedRangeI16 } from "@blockchaincommons/rand/samplers";

// Cryptographically secure (Web Crypto), the default for every helper.
const key = randomBytes(32);            // Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>
const coin = randomBool();

// Deterministic, identical to the Rust implementations for the same seed.
const rng = SeededRng.forTesting();     // the shared cross-platform fixture seed
randomBytes(16, { rng });               // reproducible bytes
nextWithUpperBoundU32(rng, 1000);       // uniform in [0, 1000)
nextInClosedRangeI16(rng, -10, 10);     // uniform in [-10, 10]

// Persist and fork a seeded generator.
const state = rng.state;                // 32 little-endian bytes
const resumed = new SeededRng(state);   // continues the same stream
const fork = rng.clone();

// Arguments are validated: anything outside the width throws a RangeError, e.g.
// nextWithUpperBoundU32(rng, 2 ** 32) -> "upperBound must be an integer in [1, 4294967295], got 4294967296"

// Any object with nextU32/nextU64/fillBytes is a RandomNumberGenerator.
const secure: SecureRng = secureRng();
secure.nextU64();
```

Runnable examples live in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-rand-ts/tree/master/examples) directory.

## Status - Beta

`bc-rand-ts` is currently under active development and in beta testing. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing. See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

### Version History

- **1.0.0-beta.1 (September 9, 2026)** - Initial beta implementation.

### Roadmap

- Continued testing and auditing on the path from beta to a stable **1.0.0** release.
- Continued parity with the Rust reference implementation as it evolves (see [`RUST_DIVERGENCES.md`](./RUST_DIVERGENCES.md)).

### Dependencies

`@blockchaincommons/rand` has **zero runtime dependencies**.

To build and work on this library, you'll need the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.12 - JavaScript runtime.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - used to install dependencies and run scripts (any node package manager works).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) >= 5.7 - language and type checker.

### Derived from ...

For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than those covered by the [Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions) or the 
[Gordian User Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions).

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-rand-ts/issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:
